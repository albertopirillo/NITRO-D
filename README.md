# My Paper Title

This repository is the official implementation of [My Paper Title](https://arxiv.org/abs/2030.12345). 

>ðŸ“‹  Optional: include a graphic explaining your approach/main result, bibtex entry, link to demos, blog posts and tutorials

## Requirements

To install requirements:
- Install Python 3.11 
- Install CUDA 12.1

Run:
```setup
python -m pip install -U setuptools pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(optional)* Install cuTensor and cuDNN for optimal performance:
```shell
python -m cupyx.tools.install_library --cuda 12.x --library cutensor
python -m cupyx.tools.install_library --cuda 12.x --library cudnn
```

Enable the installed accelerators by setting environment variables. On Linux:
```
echo 'export CUPY_ACCELERATORS=cutensor,cub' >> ~/.bashrc
```


## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data <path_to_data> --alpha 10 --beta 20
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).

## Pre-trained Models

You can download pretrained models here:

- [My awesome model](https://drive.google.com/mymodel.pth) trained on ImageNet using parameters x,y,z. 

>ðŸ“‹  Give a link to where/how the pretrained models can be downloaded and how they were trained (if applicable).  Alternatively you can have an additional column in your results table with a link to the models.

## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
